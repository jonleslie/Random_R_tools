Reversible R Markdown Document
------------------------------

This is an example Reversible R Markdown document. It will preserve code
elements for restoration in your final `.docx` file.

You can use things like inline <!--- an HTML comment ---> comments.

You can use code chunks to generate output and they will be restored:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Inline text
-----------

```{r, include= FALSE}
# A non-included chunk to provide inline chunks with values.
a <- 2
b <- 3
```

You can include calculations inline like so: `r a` plus
`r b` equals `r a + b`. Even empty inline
chunks `r NULL` will be stored and marked with hidden text in
the Word document.

Chunks with plots
-----------------

You can of course also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, dev.args=list(bg='transparent')}
plot(pressure)
```

# Additional YAML blocks can be added and will be restored
